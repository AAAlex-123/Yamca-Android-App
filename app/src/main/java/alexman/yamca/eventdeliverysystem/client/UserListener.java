/**
 * The listener interface for receiving events on a User.
 * <p>
 * The class that is interested in processing a user event either implements this interface or
 * extends the abstract {@code UserAdapter} class, overriding only the methods of interest.
 * <p>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a User using the User's
 * {@code addUserListener} method. A user event is generated whenever a User operation (such as
 * sending a message, creating a topic or listening to a topic) terminates (either successfully or
 * unsuccessfully) or when the server communicates with the User (such as receiving a message, or
 * having a topic deleted from another User). When a user event occurs, the relevant method in the
 * listener object is invoked, and the {@code UserEvent} is passed to it.
